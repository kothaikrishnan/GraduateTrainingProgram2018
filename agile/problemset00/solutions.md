/*1)How does agile testing (development) methodology differ from other testing (development) methodologies?*/

The Agile Software Development Method Uses an Iterative and Team-Based Approach

The other method uses a linear approach where the stages of the software development process must be completed in a sequential order.

/*2)What are the most important components of Agile?*/

12 Basic principles of agile project management.
 
1:Attain customer satisfaction through continuous delivery of software

2: Don't be afraid to make changes 

3: Deliver working software, with a preference to the shorter timescale

4: Developers and management must work together 

5: Build projects around motivated individuals

6:  Face-to-face interactions are the most efficient & effective modes of communication 

7: Working software is the primary measure of progress

8: Agile processes promote sustainable development

9: Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility

10: Simplicity is essential

11: The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams

12: Inspect & Adapt

/*3)What is difference between Epic,features, User stories & Tasks?*/

Epic-End product.

Feature-properties of end product.

User story-Whole requirement split into granular requirement and each granular requirement called user story.

Tasks-Assign work to each team member to complete a granular requirement.

/*4)Explain what is a product backlog in Scrum*/

The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. 
It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. 

/*5)What is Scrum Sprint?*/

Scrum sprint is a time box,regular, repeatable work cycle in scrum methodology during which work is completed and made ready for review. 

Scrum sprint (time interval)- 2 weeks- 4 weeks.

/*6)What are the artifacts of Scrum process?*/

Artifact 1: Product Backlog
Artifact 2: Sprint Backlog
Artifact 3: Product Increment

/*7)What do you understand by sprint backlog?*/

The Sprint Backlog is a subset of the Product Backlog that the team pulls into the sprint to work on. It is essentially the list of “To Do’s” a development team might be working during the current sprint.

/*8)What is the role of the Product Owner?*/

The product owner responsibilities is to have a vision of what he or she wishes to build, and convey that vision to the scrum team. 

At end of the sprint, product owner checks acceptance criteria.

/*9)What are the different roles in Scrum*/

Scrum Team
Scrum Master
Scrum Product Owner

/*10)What are the responsibilities of a Scrum Master*/

Scrum master  responsible for overseeing the correct implementation of the Scrum Framework and ensures effective product delivery by his team. 
Help communicate the product owner wish list to the project team.
Collaborate with other scrum masters to improve the methodologies efficiency.

/*11)What are different ceremonies and their importance in Scrum?*/

Sprint Planning/planning day -Starting day of sprint. 

Daily Stand-up/Scrum call - No more than 15 minutes. Stand-up is designed to quickly inform everyone of what's going on across the team. 

Iteration review/Demo day -Demonstrate work finished within the iteration, and get immediate feedback from project stakeholders. 

Retrospective- Retrospectives to find out what's working so the team can continue to focus on those areas. Also, find out what's not working and use the time to find creative solutions and develop an action plan.

/*12)What is the difference between Sprint Planning Meeting and Sprint Retrospective Meeting?*/

Sprint Planning-Starting day of sprint. The product owner describes the highest priority features to the team. The entire team agrees to complete a set of product backlog items.

Sprint Retrospective- It is attended only by the team member, the scrum master and the product owner. The product owner is optional. Start the meeting by having all team members answer two questions;
1) What went well during the sprint?
2) What doesn't well during the sprint?
3) What could be improved in the next sprint?
4) Appreciation

/*13)What is the difference between agile & scrum*/

Agile is a development methodology based on iterative and incremental approach.

Scrum is one of the implementations of agile methodology. In which incremental builds are delivered to the customer in every two to three weeks' time.

/*14)Explain Agile in 30 seconds.*/

Agile software development refers to a development methodologies based on iterative development, where solutions for requirements evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams. 

/*15)What is the Daily Stand-Up?*/

No more than 15 minutes. Stand-up is designed to quickly inform everyone of what's going on across the team. Have each team member answer the following questions:

What did I complete yesterday?
What will I work on today?
Am I blocked by anything?
